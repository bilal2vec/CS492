                    "I'm not a robot." The animated checkbox and tiles are instantly recognizable to any netizen worthy of the
                    name. What do these fuzzy letters say? How many animals are there? Find all the bicycles. As resources and
                    services have increasingly found their way onto the internet, the defenses guarding their access have grown in

                    To protect against automated attacks, websites have an interest in determining if a user is indeed human, and
                    the most common way of doing so is to ask the user to complete a series of tasks <i>presumably</i> any human
                    could easily complete but would cost a bot significant effort. This is known as a reverse Turing test. It's
                    most common reification is the CAPTCHA â€” Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and
                    Humans Apart. Here's Google's reCAPTCHAv2 (image not theirs):

                <p>
                    CAPTCHAs have become a common security measure to protect websites from automated bots. However, their
                    implementation often poses challenges for people with disabilities, leading to accessibility issues.
                    This
                    demo
                    will explore the difficulties of CAPTCHAs and suggest alternative solutions that prioritize both
                    security
                    and
                    accessibility.

                <h1>What are Captchas</h1>
                <p>
                    CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) are a type of
                    challenge-response test used to determine whether the user is human or an automated bot. They are
                    commonly
                    employed on websites to prevent spam, automated submissions, or abuse from bots.

                    There are various types of CAPTCHAs, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Text-based CAPTCHAs: These require the user to identify and type a series of distorted letters
                            and/or
                            numbers displayed in an image. The distortions make it difficult for bots to recognize the
                            characters.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Image-based CAPTCHAs: Users are asked to identify specific objects within a set of images, such as
                            selecting
                            all images that contain a particular object (e.g., traffic lights, buses, or bicycles).

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Audio CAPTCHAs: Users listen to an audio clip with distorted speech or background noise and type
                            the
                            words
                            they hear. This type of CAPTCHA is primarily intended for visually impaired users.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mathematical CAPTCHAs: Users solve a simple math problem, like adding or subtracting two numbers,
                            and
                            enter
                            the answer to prove they are human.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Google's reCAPTCHA: This system utilizes advanced risk analysis techniques to determine whether a
                            user
                            is
                            human or a bot. It often requires users to click a checkbox that says "I'm not a robot" and,
                            depending
                            on
                            the user's behavior, may present additional challenges like image recognition tasks.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    CAPTCHAs help protect websites from spam and malicious activities but can also create accessibility
                    challenges for users with disabilities, such as those with visual impairments or cognitive difficulties.

                <p>
                    This is a demo of a CAPTCHA game. The goal is to select all images that contain a crosswalk. The
                    images
                    are
                    displayed in a grid, and the user can select an image by clicking on it. The user can also deselect
                    an
                    image
                    by clicking on it again. The user can submit their selection by clicking the "Submit" button. The
                    user
                    can
                    play again by clicking the "Play Again" button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game is intended to be a simplified version of a CAPTCHA. It is not intended to be a
                    replacement for
                    a
                    CAPTCHA, but rather a demonstration of the accessibility challenges that CAPTCHAs can pose for
                    users
                    with
                    disabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is not designed to be accessible to users with visual impairments. The images are displayed in
                    a grid and the user must select the images by clicking on them. This is not accessible to users with
                    visual impairments because they cannot see the images. The user must also be able to see the images in
                    order to identify the crosswalks. This is not accessible to users with visual impairments because they
                    cannot see the images.

                    There are three types of colorblindness (A, B, C) with A being the most common. This is an example of
                    how solving a CAPTCHA might look to a person with a A color-blindness ...
                </p>

                <p>
                    As you can see, it is difficult for a person with a with color-blindness to solve a CAPTCHA and
                    especially captchas that require color information to solve and would
                    not be able to fully access many parts of the web. talk about how you might be able to deduce the color
                    of a traffic light from the position of the active light but this becomes hard/impossible in the case of
                    horizontal traffic lights. Also mention how if the question was to select all images of traffic lights
                    that are painted yellow instead of black for example, this task would be even more difficult.
