                    To protect against automated attacks, websites have an interest in determining if a user is indeed human, and
                    the most common way of doing so is to use what's known as a reverse Turing test. That is, ask the user to
                    complete a series of tasks <i>presumably</i> any human could easily complete but would cost a bot significant
                    effort. Its most common reification is the CAPTCHA â€” the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell
                    Computers and Humans Apart. Here's Google's reCAPTCHAv2 (image not theirs):

                    In the race to stump machines, it's not the machines that have been left behind, but many of our fellow
                    humans. The pervasive assumption that all humans see, think, and understand in the same way has made CAPTCHA,
                    especially as machine vision exceeds human vision, more a discriminator of ability among humans than against
                    machines. But how do we make a fundamentally inaccessible puzzle accessible? In the interactions below, we

                <p>
                    This is a demo of the CAPTCHA game. The goal is to select all images that contain a crosswalk. The
                    images are displayed in a grid, and the user can select an image by clicking on it. Clicking again de-selects
                    an image. Submit the chosen images for evaluation by clicking "Submit" and play again by clicking the "Play
                    Again" button that appears. We encourage you to play multiple times to get a representative average time.
                </p>
                <!-- @elena could we add a start game button and a timer + running average? -->

                    This game is intended to be a simplified version of a CAPTCHA, not a replacement. By simulating challenges
                    that may arise in completing the game, we aim to demonstrate how inaccessible CAPTCHAs become. This difficulty
                    should be reflected in the average time required. We try to be as faithful as possible to the conditions that
                    may lead to these challenges, and take full responsibility for any inaccuracies.

                    About 12 million Americans have some form of vision impairment, of which 1 million are legally blind. 4.2
                    million have uncorrectable vision impairment, a number expected to double by 2050 due to the epidemics of
                    diabetes and other chronic conditions. The most common impairment comes from vision distortion as a result of
                    refractive errors (near- and far-sightedness), cataracts, or age-related macular degeneration. Roughly 20
                    million American over 40 have some form of cataracts and 1.8 million suffer macular degeneration. Macular
                    degeneration has no known cure.

                    Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels behind the eye, leading to patches of receptors
                    unable to process light. An estimated 4.1 million Americans are affected by retinopathy of some form, of which
                    nearly a million are deemed "vision-threatening".

                    Color-blindness is a condition that affects 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women. It's characterized by the
                    inability to distinguish between certain colors, most commonly between red and green (protanopia). This
                    affects not just the colors red and green, but all colors (e.g. purple) that have them as a base color. Many
                    color blind people are surprised to learn that peanut butter (which has a component of red color) is not in
                    fact green. In a box of 24 crayons, most color blind people can only accurately identify 5 of them.

                <p>
                    We present these remedies assuming a solution would keep the graphical interface. An immediately obvious
                    solution is multimodal CAPTCHAs: users may select between visual, auditory, or even biometric inputs, but
                    we save that for the very end.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Humans are hardwired to recognize faces and the emotions they display even with quite severe distortions. A
                    raised eyebrow or a sideways head are easy to recognize because of the numerous contours that define the human
                    face. Colors no longer matter; we still recognize the person under the face paint. Asking users to identify
                    faces with a particular emotion is an effective way to bypass visual distortions to a certain degree.
                </p>

                <!-- @bilal if you want to add a faces captcha with distortions, up to you-->

                <p>
                    Emotion CAPTCHAs may fail for users with social-emotional agnosia or alexithymia, which inhibits the
                    characterization and understanding of emotional display. Both often occur in individuals with schizophrenia or
                    autism.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a similar vein, motion CAPTCHAs rely on the ability to understand cause and effect in the physical world. A
                    short GIF of a person or object moving through space is enough to answer the question "what preceded this" or
                    "what follows this". For example, a person moving their arms towards their chest suggests a hug, or a lamp
                    precariously placed suggests it will fall over. Given multiple choices of possibilities, the user selects the
                    correct one.
                </p>

                <!-- @bilal idk what graphic should go here, there's an example in the doc -->

                <p>
                    This solution is especially effective if the user has extremely limited vision. Screen readers, which are
                    normally inoperable on CAPTCHAs (that would defeat the purpose) can be used to read alt-text on images (e.g.
                    "the lamp is wobbly") as well as the multiple choices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dyslexia, which affects the ability to read, is present in around 3-7% of the population at varying degrees
                    and up to 20% may have some general symptoms that go unnoticed and undiagnosed. We recreate here what a
                    dyslexic reader might experience with normal text. It should be clear that heavily convoluted series of
                    letters with neither context nor morphemic cues (ie. prefixes, word stems, etc. ) are even more difficult.
                    Below we present samples to any user from the "difficult" text CAPTCHA dataset.

                    Inaccessibility doesn't even need to come from psychological conditions. Most of the world does not speak
                    English or use the Latin alphabet. Text CAPTCHAs which require users to type out an answer in an alternate
                    keyboard while matching unfamiliar characters is an easily solvable problem â€” generate text in different
                    alphabets. While we expect the most commonly used websites to be internationalized (support different
                    languages), CAPTCHAs were conspicuously behind in this trend for several years. Image based CAPTCHAs, such as
                    the ones Google provide, support internationalization (another good reason why users must be able to choose
                    their preferred modality). Here's some Cyrillic (alphabet of 32 letters), try recreating it.

                <p>
                    Apart from increased internationalization, no good workarounds exist for text-based CAPTCHA solutions. Whereas
                    with common visual impairments the problem is with transmitting information, textual impairment is usually
                    caused by an underlying difficulty in interpreting information. Given that solving times for text based
                    CAPTCHAs are only marginally shorter than image based CAPTCHA but have a higher rate of inaccuracy, we believe
                    it should be completely eliminated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We discuss the concept of a "MAPTCHA", or mathematical CAPTCHA, for the sake of completeness. A numerical prompt supported by a screen reader offers a logic or reasoning puzzle to the user. This fails to work for several reasons including for users with cognitive impairments such as dyscalculia. The general public also often exhibits an inability to reason.

                </h1>
                Audio CAPTCHAs have almost completely been phased out. A computer generated voice reads a sentence or word which
                the user types out. Not only is sound ineffective in noisy environments, computer generated audio is much more
                difficult to interpret than human speech. The most common impairment, hearing loss or deafness, has little room
                for accessibility improvements from a developer's point of view. You can only turn up the volume, and that only
                goes so far. Needing to replay the audio repeatedly for all users represents a poor user experience. We think
                audio CAPTCHAs should only be offered as an alternate modal when visual modes fail; it should never be the
                default.

                    Biometrics, such as fingerprints and facial profiles, provide a secure form of identification. However, the 
                    limitations of biometrics must be considered, such as those who do not have fingers or who are too old 
                    for fingerprints to be viable.

                    Zero knowledge proof is an interactive solution that requires a hardware device from a reliable manufacturer,

                    Third-party solutions include Google's reCAPTCHA v2 and v3. The v2 reCAPTCHA process involves presenting the user with 
                    a challenge, such as identifying objects in an image or solving a math problem, and then analyzing their response to 
                    determine whether they are human. The challenge is designed to be very easy for humans to solve but difficult for bots to bypass. 
                    Conversely, reCAPTCHA v3 does not require any user interaction or challenge solving. Instead, it runs in the background of 
                    the website and evaluates the user's behavior on the site, such as mouse movements and keyboard input, to determine the 
                    probability that they are a bot. However, one potential disadvantage of these is that they requires website owners 
                    to share a significant amount of user data with Google, including IP addresses, user agents, and other browsing behavior. 
                    This may raise privacy concerns for users and website owners who are uncomfortable sharing this information with a 
                    third party. Furthermore, as AI becomes more advanced, advanced bots may be able to bypass the challenge or use 
                    techniques such as human emulation to fool the system.

                    If you thought captchas were hard to do with vision loss, imagine how hard it would be to do them with a
                    learning disability like Dyslexia

<!-- <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        CAPTCHAs have become a common security measure to protect websites from automated bots. However, their
        implementation often poses challenges for people with disabilities, leading to accessibility issues.
        This
        demo
        will explore the difficulties of CAPTCHAs and suggest alternative solutions that prioritize both
        security
        and
        accessibility.

                <h1>What are Captchas</h1>
                <p>
                    CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) are a type of
                    challenge-response test used to determine whether the user is human or an automated bot. They are
                    commonly
                    employed on websites to prevent spam, automated submissions, or abuse from bots.

                    There are various types of CAPTCHAs, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Text-based CAPTCHAs: These require the user to identify and type a series of distorted letters
                            and/or
                            numbers displayed in an image. The distortions make it difficult for bots to recognize the
                            characters.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Image-based CAPTCHAs: Users are asked to identify specific objects within a set of images, such as
                            selecting
                            all images that contain a particular object (e.g., traffic lights, buses, or bicycles).

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Audio CAPTCHAs: Users listen to an audio clip with distorted speech or background noise and type
                            the
                            words
                            they hear. This type of CAPTCHA is primarily intended for visually impaired users.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mathematical CAPTCHAs: Users solve a simple math problem, like adding or subtracting two numbers,
                            and
                            enter
                            the answer to prove they are human.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Google's reCAPTCHA: This system utilizes advanced risk analysis techniques to determine whether a
                            user
                            is
                            human or a bot. It often requires users to click a checkbox that says "I'm not a robot" and,
                            depending
                            on
                            the user's behavior, may present additional challenges like image recognition tasks.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    CAPTCHAs help protect websites from spam and malicious activities but can also create accessibility
                    challenges for users with disabilities, such as those with visual impairments or cognitive difficulties.
