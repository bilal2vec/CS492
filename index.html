                    the

                    and
                    services have increasingly found their way onto the internet, the defenses guarding their access have
                    grown in

                    To protect against automated attacks, websites have an interest in determining if a user is indeed
                    human, and
                    the most common way of doing so is to use what's known as a reverse Turing test. That is, ask the user
                    to
                    complete a series of tasks <i>presumably</i> any human could easily complete but would cost a bot
                    significant
                    effort. Its most common reification is the CAPTCHA â€” the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell
                    Computers and Humans Apart. Here's Google's reCAPTCHAv2 (image not theirs):

                    In the race to stump machines, it's not the machines that have been left behind, but many of our fellow
                    humans. The pervasive assumption that all humans see, think, and understand in the same way has made
                    CAPTCHA,
                    especially as machine vision exceeds human vision, more a discriminator of ability among humans than
                    against
                    machines. But how do we make a fundamentally inaccessible puzzle accessible? In the interactions below,
                    we

                <p>
                    This is a demo of the CAPTCHA game. The goal is to select all images that contain a crosswalk. The
                    images are displayed in a grid, and the user can select an image by clicking on it. Clicking again
                    de-selects
                    an image. Submit the chosen images for evaluation by clicking "Submit" and play again by clicking the
                    "Play
                    Again" button that appears. We encourage you to play multiple times to get a representative average
                    time.

                    This game is intended to be a simplified version of a CAPTCHA, not a replacement. By simulating
                    challenges
                    that may arise in completing the game, we aim to demonstrate how inaccessible CAPTCHAs become. This
                    difficulty
                    should be reflected in the average time required. We try to be as faithful as possible to the conditions
                    that
                    may lead to these challenges, and take full responsibility for any inaccuracies.

                    About 12 million Americans have some form of vision impairment, of which 1 million are legally blind.
                    4.2
                    million have uncorrectable vision impairment, a number expected to double by 2050 due to the epidemics
                    of
                    diabetes and other chronic conditions. The most common impairment comes from vision distortion as a
                    result of
                    refractive errors (near- and far-sightedness), cataracts, or age-related macular degeneration. Roughly
                    20
                    million American over 40 have some form of cataracts and 1.8 million suffer macular degeneration.

                    degeneration has no known cure.

                    unable to process light. An estimated 4.1 million Americans are affected by retinopathy of some form, of

                    Color-blindness is a condition that affects 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women. It's characterized by the
                    inability to distinguish between certain colors, most commonly between red and green (protanopia). This
                    affects not just the colors red and green, but all colors (e.g. purple) that have them as a base color.
                    Many
                    color blind people are surprised to learn that peanut butter (which has a component of red color) is not
                    in
                    fact green. In a box of 24 crayons, most color blind people can only accurately identify 5 of them.

                    In the following example, the user is asked to select all images of traffic lights with green signals.
                    If the user is color blind, they may not be able to distinguish between the green and red signals and
                    would be forced to rely on other cues such as the position of the lit signal in the traffic light. This
                    is further complicated by cases such as where the traffic light is set up in a horizontal orientation,
                    or different countries where traffic lights obey different conventions

                <p>
                    We present these remedies assuming a solution would keep the graphical interface. An immediately obvious
                    solution is multimodal CAPTCHAs: users may select between visual, auditory, or even biometric inputs,
                    but
                    we save that for the very end.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Humans are hardwired to recognize faces and the emotions they display even with quite severe
                    distortions. A
                    raised eyebrow or a sideways head are easy to recognize because of the numerous contours that define the
                    human
                    face. Colors no longer matter; we still recognize the person under the face paint. Asking users to
                    identify
                    faces with a particular emotion is an effective way to bypass visual distortions to a certain degree.
                </p>

                <div style="width:100%;">
                    <img src="images/emotion_blur.png" class="motion_captcha"
                        alt="An example of the captcha where you are shown a short video of a person performing an action then
                        asked to choose the option that best fits the video" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    Emotion CAPTCHAs may fail for users with social-emotional agnosia or alexithymia, which inhibits the
                    characterization and understanding of emotional display. Both often occur in individuals with
                    schizophrenia or
                    autism.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a similar vein, motion CAPTCHAs rely on the ability to understand cause and effect in the physical
                    world. A
                    short GIF of a person or object moving through space is enough to answer the question "what preceded
                    this" or
                    "what follows this". For example, a person moving their arms towards their chest suggests a hug, or a
                    lamp
                    precariously placed suggests it will fall over. Given multiple choices of possibilities, the user
                    selects the
                    correct one.
                </p>

                <div style="width:100%;">
                    <img src="images/motion_captcha.png" class="motion_captcha"
                        alt="An example of the captcha where you are shown a short video of a person performing an action then
                        asked to choose the option that best fits the video" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    This solution is especially effective if the user has extremely limited vision. Screen readers, which
                    are
                    normally inoperable on CAPTCHAs (that would defeat the purpose) can be used to read alt-text on images
                    (e.g.
                    "the lamp is wobbly") as well as the multiple choices.
                </p>

                    Inaccessibility doesn't even need to come from psychological conditions. Most of the world does not
                    speak
                    English or use the Latin alphabet. Text CAPTCHAs which require users to type out an answer in an
                    alternate
                    keyboard while matching unfamiliar characters is an easily solvable problem â€” generate text in different
                    alphabets. While we expect the most commonly used websites to be internationalized (support different
                    languages), CAPTCHAs were conspicuously behind in this trend for several years. Image based CAPTCHAs,
                    such as
                    the ones Google provide, support internationalization (another good reason why users must be able to
                    choose
                    their preferred modality). Here's a real-life example of a captcha in Cyrillic (alphabet of 32 letters
                    that over 250 million people in Eurasia read and write), typing out a sentence such as "aÐ»Ð¼Ð°Ð· school" on
                    an English
                    keyboard is exceedingly difficult.

                    caused by an underlying difficulty in interpreting information. Given that solving times for text based
                    CAPTCHAs are only marginally shorter than image based CAPTCHA but have a higher rate of inaccuracy, we
                    believe
                    it should be completely eliminated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We discuss the concept of a "MAPTCHA", or mathematical CAPTCHA, for the sake of completeness. A
                    numerical prompt supported by a screen reader offers a logic or reasoning puzzle to the user. This fails
                    to work for several reasons including for users with cognitive impairments such as dyscalculia. The
                    general public also often exhibits an inability to reason.

                    Auditory Impairment
                </h1>
                Audio CAPTCHAs have almost completely been phased out. A computer generated voice reads a sentence or word
                which
                the user types out. Not only is sound ineffective in noisy environments, computer generated audio is much
                more
                difficult to interpret than human speech. The most common impairment, hearing loss or deafness, has little
                room
                for accessibility improvements from a developer's point of view. You can only turn up the volume, and that
                only
                goes so far. Needing to replay the audio repeatedly represents a poor user experience. We
                think
                audio CAPTCHAs should only be offered as an alternate modality when visual modes fail; it should never be the
                default.

                    General Solutions
                </h1>

                <p>
                    Biometrics, such as fingerprints and facial profiles, provide a secure form of identification. However,
                    the
                    limitations of biometrics must be considered, such as for those who do not have fingers or who are too old
                    for fingerprints to be discernable. Privacy concerns abound. Most importantly, most devices such as laptops
                    and some smartphones are not equipped with fingerprint sensors, making this solution infeasible for the time
                    being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zero knowledge proof and 2-factor authentication (2FA) have recently become common as security measures a step
                    beyond usernames and passwords. A 2-factor authentication usually involves generating the keypass or pin on
                    another trusted device which is then used to verify a user. However, a bot is able to recreate these steps. A
                    cryptographic attestation of personhood implements biometric authentication <i>without</i> passing any
                    biometric information, instead producing digital certificates used to verify personhood. This is called a
                    zero-knowledge proof; no information is leaked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A hardware alternative exists in the Yubikey, a USB verification device that only requires button presses from
                    the user. Purchasing authentication devices at scale is prohibitively expensive and comes with third party
                    provided statistical analysis on user behaviour.
                </p>
                <div style="width:100%;">
                    <img src="images/yubikey.png" class="motion_captcha"
                        alt="An example of the captcha where you are shown a short video of a person performing an action then
                        asked to choose the option that best fits the video" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    Other third-party solutions include Google's reCAPTCHA v2 and noCAPTCHA v3. The v2 reCAPTCHA process involves
                    presenting the user with a visual identification challenge, and then analyzes response accuracy and time to
                    determine whether the user is are human. Not every CATPCHA iteration will result in a challenge, but as
                    demonstrated above, these can be uniquely difficult for certain groups of people.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Conversely, reCAPTCHA v3 does not require any user interaction or challenge solving. Instead, it runs in the
                    background of the website and evaluates the user's behavior such as mouse movements and keyboard input to
                    determine the probability of a machine. A score is returned to the host website, which sometimes then decides
                    whether to issue a traditional CAPTCHA. While it minimizes user interaction, one potential disadvantage is
                    that they requires website owners to share a significant amount of user data with Google including IP
                    addresses, user agents, and other browsing behavior. This may raise privacy concerns for users and website
                    owners who are uncomfortable sharing this information with a third party. Bots, if willing to spend the time
                    and effort to replicate human behaviour, also have a fair chance of bypassing this test.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, we introduce the concept of a honeypot. Bears like honey! Bots like buttons. Click in the area at the
                    end of this paragraph. If you were a user, you'd never think to click that invisible button, but a bot reading
                    the HTML describing the page would. This technique is called a "Honeypot CAPTCHA" and, for example, can be
                    implemented by asking the user to leave a text field blank when filling out a form or leaving time consuming
                    traps that only bots would engage with. Widely used in the field of load balancing and network security,
                    honeypots and probabilistic analysis are commonly used in backend systems, not user interfaces, but
                    nevertheless remains an area of active research. <button class="honeypot" id="honeypot">Bot!</button>

                    To sum up...
                </h1>
                <p>
                    An accessible CAPTCHA is difficult to design, and there are no solutions that the industry has found
                    convincing and effective enough to implement at scale. We conspicuously fail to mention how effective many of
                    these tactics are against the growing capabilities of artificial intelligence because, well, none of these are
                    very effective. Google stopped using audio based CAPTCHAs because their own voice recognition engine beat it
                    99.8% of the time. Text and object classification by the latest transformers have rendered distortion based
                    techniques moot. Cause and effect tests are easily broken by machine learning models able to follow
                    instructions, read emotions, and explain comics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We must assume that such capabilities will, in short order, because so widespread and accessible (haha) that
                    CAPTCHAs no longer have a role anywhere. Websites will simply have to adapt to assuming all users are bots, or
                    proofs based techniques will become the norm. Perhaps one day everyone will carry a Yubikey and a proof of
                    humanity badge. But we think this is for the better â€” humanity will no longer spend a total of 500 years every
                    day on CAPTCHAs. Let's change the paradigm, and let's make sure everyone is treated as a human being.
